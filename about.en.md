## SHLUG

Shanghai Linux User Group (abbreviated as SHLUG) was founded in July 1997 and was the first Linux User Group in China. We are dedicated to promoting Linux, as well as advocating FOSS (short for Free and Open Source Software) culture, sharing experience about FOSS technologies, and helping other Linux users.

In the 20+ years SHLUG has been around, we have organized a lot of offline meetings, covering both Linux and other areas of information technologies. We also have a Hacking Thursday Night meetup every week and a sharing session every month on a specific topic related to FOSS.

We have a mailing list (in Chinese) on [http://groups.google.com/group/shlug](http://groups.google.com/group/shlug), and a few WeChat groups (in Chinese) for online communications. We are continuing in our initial spirit of Promoting Linux, Sharing Experience, and Assisting Comrades.

## Hacking Thursday

### What is Hacking Thursday

Hacking Thursday was born in the Taiwan freedom software community, initiated by a few FOSS developers from Taipei. They would invite fellow developers and users to meet up every Thursday at a designated place. In 2010, Yucang (雨苍) from Tainan moved to Shanghai due to his work and brought this convention to the Shanghai Linux community.
